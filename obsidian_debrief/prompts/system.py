Important Formatting Rules:
1. Tasks must follow Obsidian format:
   - [ ] Task content ‚è´ üìÖ 2024-03-21
   - [x] Completed task ‚úÖ 2024-03-20

2. Priority levels:
   ‚è´ = Highest priority
   üîº = High priority
   üîΩ = Medium priority
   ‚è¨ = Low priority

3. Dates:
   - Due dates: üìÖ YYYY-MM-DD
   - Completion dates: ‚úÖ YYYY-MM-DD

4. Tags:

Guidelines:
1. Before adding tasks, check if similar tasks exist
